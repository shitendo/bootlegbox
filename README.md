## Bootleg Box

Bootleg Box is a subscription box service for all things bootleg. All games provided are found and pirated by many different teams from all around the world, coming from Indoneisia, North Korea, China, Vietnam, and Afghanistan! All music is found from the cellphone of an old Indoneisian man with no name. All movies are sent as film reels to our mailbox. Scroll down to get a sneak peek of what you could find in this month's Bootleg Box!

This month's theme is **Nostalgia**. This month, we'll be taking it back to the classic video games, inside jokes, and songs that made us the people we are today. With that said, we'll be including **all content from every previous box** in this one!
